# Music Files

Just drag and drop your music files here! The music player will automatically detect them.

## Supported Formats

- MP3 (recommended)
- WAV
- OGG
- OPUS
- M4A
- FLAC
- AAC
- WebM

## How It Works

1. Add any audio file to this folder
2. The music player automatically scans and lists all tracks
3. Track names are generated from filenames (e.g., `my-song.mp3` → "My Song")

## File Naming Tips

- Use dashes or underscores as separators: `lofi-study.mp3` or `chill_beats.mp3`
- The player auto-capitalizes: `night-owl.mp3` → "Night Owl"
- Avoid special characters

## Example

```
public/music/
├── lofi-study.mp3     → "Lofi Study"
├── chill-beats.mp3    → "Chill Beats"
├── focus-mode.mp3     → "Focus Mode"
├── night-owl.mp3      → "Night Owl"
└── dream-state.mp3    → "Dream State"
```

## Notes

- Files are scanned on page load
- Refresh the page to see newly added tracks
- Spotify integration works independently of local files
