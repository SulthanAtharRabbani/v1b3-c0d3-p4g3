      "Reduced memory usage"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Pipelining increases instruction throughput by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions. While each instruction still takes multiple cycles, the processor completes more instructions per unit time."

    "question": "What is a data hazard in pipelining?",
    "options": [
      "Hardware cannot support instruction combination",
      "An instruction depends on a result from a previous instruction",
      "Branch instruction outcome is unknown",
      "Memory access conflicts"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "A data hazard occurs when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction that hasn't completed yet. For example, a SUB instruction needs the result from a previous ADD instruction."

      "Preventing structural hazards",

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Forwarding (bypassing) resolves data hazards by routing the result of an instruction directly to dependent instructions in the pipeline, without waiting for it to be written to the register file."

    "question": "What is a control hazard?",
    "options": [
      "Multiple instructions need the same resource",
      "An instruction needs data from a previous instruction",
      "Branch instruction makes next instruction address unknown",
      "Memory bandwidth is exceeded"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "A control hazard occurs when the pipeline cannot determine the next instruction address due to a branch instruction. The processor doesn't know whether to fetch the next sequential instruction or branch to a different location."

    "options": [
      "Execute one instruction at a time",
      "Execute multiple instructions simultaneously",
      "Always use in-order execution",
      "Have single execution units"

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Superscalar processors can execute multiple instructions simultaneously by having multiple execution units and using instruction-level parallelism. They can achieve higher throughput than pipelined processors."
