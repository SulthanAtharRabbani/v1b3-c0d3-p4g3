    "question": "What is the purpose of an interrupt?",
    "options": [
      "To speed up program execution",
      "To signal that an event needs immediate attention",
      "To increase clock speed",
      "To manage memory allocation"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Interrupts are signals to the processor that an event needs immediate attention. They allow the processor to respond to external events efficiently without continuously polling devices."

    "question": "Which register contains the address of the next instruction to be executed?",
    "options": [
      "Memory Address Register (MAR)",
      "Instruction Register (IR)",
      "Program Counter (PC)",
      "Memory Buffer Register (MBR)"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "The Program Counter (PC) contains the address of the next instruction to be fetched from memory. It is automatically incremented after each fetch operation."

    "question": "What is the advantage of nested interrupts over disabled interrupts?",
    "options": [
      "Simpler implementation",
      "Faster execution",
      "Better responsiveness for critical events",
      "Lower power consumption"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Nested interrupts allow higher priority interrupts to interrupt lower priority handlers, providing better responsiveness for critical events. This requires a priority system but ensures important events are handled promptly."

    "id": "m3-q5",
    "question": "What type of interrupt is caused by arithmetic overflow?",
    "options": [
      "I/O Interrupt",
      "Program Interrupt",
      "Timer Interrupt",
      "Hardware Failure Interrupt"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Program interrupts are caused by internal conditions such as arithmetic overflow, division by zero, or invalid opcodes. These are distinct from external interrupts like I/O or timer interrupts."
