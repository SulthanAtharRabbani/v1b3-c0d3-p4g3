# Module 4: Memory Hierarchy

Memory is one of the most critical components in computer architecture, directly impacting system performance. This module explores the memory hierarchy from the fastest cache to slower main memory.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the principle of locality
- Describe memory hierarchy levels and characteristics
- Understand cache mapping techniques
- Compare replacement algorithms and write policies
