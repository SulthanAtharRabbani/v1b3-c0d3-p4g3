# Computer Organization and Architecture

This comprehensive course covers the fundamental principles of computer organization and architecture, based on William Stallings' internationally recognized textbook. The course is designed for students with no prior background in computer science or engineering, systematically building knowledge from basic concepts to advanced architectural principles.

## Course Overview

Computer Organization and Architecture is the study of how computers are structured and how they function at the hardware level. This field forms the foundation for understanding modern computing systems, from embedded processors in smartphones to high-performance servers and supercomputers.

### What You Will Learn

This course provides a thorough understanding of:

- **Structure**: The way in which components are interrelated
- **Function**: The operation of each individual component as part of the structure
- **Organization**: The operational units and their interconnections
- **Architecture**: Attributes visible to the programmer

### Course Structure

The course follows a top-down approach, starting with the major components of a computer system and progressively examining lower levels of detail:

1. **Computer System Level**: Processor, memory, I/O, and interconnection
2. **Processor Level**: Control unit, registers, ALU, and execution units
3. **Control Unit Level**: Microoperations and control signals

### Key Topics

- Computer structure and function fundamentals
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Memory hierarchy and cache design
- Instruction set architecture and addressing modes
- Processor design and pipelining
- Parallel processing and multicore architectures

### Target Audience

This course is designed for:
- Students with no prior computer science or engineering background
- Self-learners interested in understanding computer hardware fundamentals
- Software developers seeking deeper hardware knowledge
- Anyone preparing for computer architecture courses or certifications

### Textbook Reference

This course is based on "Computer Organization and Architecture: Designing for Performance" by William Stallings (11th Edition), ensuring industry-standard education.
