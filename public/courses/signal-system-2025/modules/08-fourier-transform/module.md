# Module 8: Fourier Transform

This module introduces the Fourier transform for analyzing non-periodic signals in the frequency domain.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Define and apply the Fourier transform
2. Calculate Fourier transforms of common signals
3. Understand continuous spectra
4. Apply the inverse Fourier transform

## Topics Covered

1. **Fourier Transform Definition** - From periodic to aperiodic signals
2. **Common Transform Pairs** - Important Fourier transforms
3. **Inverse Fourier Transform** - Recovering the time signal

## Estimated Time

This module should take approximately 4 hours to complete.
