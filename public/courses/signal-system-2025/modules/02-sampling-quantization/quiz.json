    "question": "According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, what is the minimum sampling rate for a signal with maximum frequency f_max?",
    "options": [
      "f_max",
      "2 × f_max",
      "f_max / 2",
      "π × f_max"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The Nyquist rate is 2 × f_max. To perfectly reconstruct a band-limited signal, the sampling frequency must be greater than twice the maximum frequency component."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Nyquist frequency when sampling at 48 kHz?",
    "options": [
      "48 kHz",
      "24 kHz",
      "96 kHz",
      "12 kHz"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The Nyquist frequency is half the sampling frequency: f_N = f_s/2 = 48/2 = 24 kHz."
  },
  {
    "question": "A signal with bandwidth 15 kHz is sampled at 20 kHz. What phenomenon occurs?",
    "options": [
      "Perfect reconstruction",
      "Oversampling",
      "Aliasing",
      "Quantization noise"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The Nyquist rate should be 2 × 15 = 30 kHz. Since 20 kHz < 30 kHz, the signal is undersampled and aliasing occurs."
  },
  {
    "question": "A 70 Hz sinusoid is sampled at 80 Hz. What frequency will be observed after sampling?",
    "options": [
      "70 Hz",
      "10 Hz",
      "40 Hz",
      "80 Hz"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "With f_s = 80 Hz, Nyquist frequency is 40 Hz. The 70 Hz signal folds: f_alias = 80 - 70 = 10 Hz."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of an anti-aliasing filter?",
    "options": [
      "To increase signal amplitude",
      "To remove frequencies above the Nyquist frequency before sampling",
      "To convert digital signals to analog",
      "To reduce quantization noise"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Anti-aliasing filters are low-pass filters that remove frequency components above the Nyquist frequency before sampling to prevent aliasing."
  },
  {
    "question": "For uniform quantization with step size Δ, what is the maximum quantization error?",
    "options": [
      "Δ",
      "Δ/2",
      "2Δ",
      "Δ/4"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The quantization error ranges from -Δ/2 to +Δ/2, so the maximum absolute error is Δ/2."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many quantization levels are available with 10-bit encoding?",
    "options": [
      "10",
      "100",
      "512",
      "1024"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "The number of quantization levels is L = 2^N = 2^10 = 1024 levels."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the approximate SQNR improvement per additional quantization bit?",
    "options": [
      "3 dB per bit",
      "6 dB per bit",
      "10 dB per bit",
      "1 dB per bit"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The SQNR formula SQNR_dB ≈ 6.02N + 1.76 dB shows approximately 6 dB improvement per additional bit."
  },
  {
    "question": "In PCM, if the sampling rate is 8 kHz and each sample is encoded with 8 bits, what is the bit rate?",
    "options": [
      "8 kbps",
      "64 kbps",
      "16 kbps",
      "1 Mbps"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "PCM bit rate R = N × f_s = 8 × 8000 = 64,000 bps = 64 kbps."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is companding used in telephony?",
    "options": [
      "To reduce the number of bits needed",
      "To improve SQNR for small signals and handle wide dynamic range",
      "To increase the sampling rate",
      "To eliminate the need for anti-aliasing filters"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Companding (μ-law or A-law) provides non-uniform quantization that gives better SQNR for small signals while maintaining good dynamic range, making 8-bit telephony quality equivalent to ~12-bit uniform quantization."
