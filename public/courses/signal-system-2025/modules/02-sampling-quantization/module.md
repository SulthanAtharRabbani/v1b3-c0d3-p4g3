# Module 2: Sampling and Quantization

This module covers the fundamental concepts of converting analog signals to digital form through sampling and quantization.

## Module Overview

Digital signal processing requires converting continuous-time, continuous-amplitude signals into discrete-time, discrete-amplitude representations. This module explains the theoretical foundations and practical considerations for this conversion process.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Apply the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem
2. Understand aliasing and how to prevent it
3. Perform quantization and calculate quantization error
4. Understand PCM encoding

## Topics Covered

1. **Sampling Theory** - Nyquist theorem and reconstruction
2. **Aliasing** - Spectral overlap and prevention
3. **Quantization** - Discrete amplitude representation

## Estimated Time

This module should take approximately 4 hours to complete.
