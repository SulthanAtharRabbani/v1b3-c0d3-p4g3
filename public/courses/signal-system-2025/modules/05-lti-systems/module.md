# Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Systems

## Module Overview

Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems form the foundation of classical signal processing and system analysis. These systems possess two fundamental properties—linearity and time-invariance—that enable powerful analytical techniques and simplify system design.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Define and test for linearity using homogeneity and additivity properties
2. Identify time-invariant systems and distinguish them from time-varying systems
3. Understand the role of impulse response in system characterization
4. Apply LTI properties to analyze system behavior

## Lessons

- **Lesson 1:** Linearity - Superposition principle and linearity testing
- **Lesson 2:** Time-Invariance - Time-invariance property and system classification
- **Lesson 3:** Impulse Response - System characterization using impulse response

## Key Concepts

- **Linearity:** Superposition principle (homogeneity + additivity)
- **Time-Invariance:** System behavior is independent of time origin
- **Impulse Response:** Complete characterization of LTI systems
- **LTI Systems:** Systems that are both linear and time-invariant

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of signals and systems
- Familiarity with integration and differentiation
- Knowledge of impulse functions
