# Module 10: System Analysis with Fourier Transform

This module applies Fourier transform techniques to analyze linear time-invariant systems in the frequency domain.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Determine frequency response from impulse response
2. Analyze magnitude and phase response
3. Design basic filters
4. Compute system outputs in frequency domain

## Topics Covered

1. **Frequency Response** - Transfer functions and Bode plots
2. **Filtering Concepts** - LPF, HPF, BPF characteristics
3. **System Output Analysis** - Frequency domain computation

## Estimated Time

This module should take approximately 4 hours to complete.
