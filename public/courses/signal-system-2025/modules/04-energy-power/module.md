# Module 4: Energy and Power Signals

This module covers the classification of signals based on their energy and power content, which is fundamental for signal analysis.

## Module Overview

All signals can be classified as either energy signals, power signals, or neither. Understanding this classification helps determine appropriate analysis techniques and determines whether a signal can be physically realized.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Calculate signal energy for continuous and discrete signals
2. Calculate signal power for continuous and discrete signals
3. Classify signals as energy or power type
4. Understand the relationship between energy and power

## Topics Covered

1. **Energy Signals** - Definition and calculation
2. **Power Signals** - Definition and calculation
3. **Signal Classification** - Energy vs power vs neither

## Estimated Time

This module should take approximately 3 hours to complete.
