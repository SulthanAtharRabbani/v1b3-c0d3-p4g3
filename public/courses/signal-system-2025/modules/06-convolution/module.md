# Convolution

## Module Overview

Convolution is the fundamental mathematical operation that relates the input and output of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. This module covers the convolution integral for continuous-time systems, the convolution sum for discrete-time systems, and the important properties of convolution.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Compute continuous-time convolution using the convolution integral
2. Apply the graphical method for convolution
3. Calculate discrete-time convolution using the convolution sum
4. Utilize convolution properties to simplify system analysis
