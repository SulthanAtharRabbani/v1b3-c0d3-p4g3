    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The convolution integral y(t) = ∫x(τ)h(t-τ)dτ integrates over all τ, with h(t-τ) being the flipped and shifted impulse response."

      "Flip one of the signals",
      "Shift both signals",
      "Multiply the signals"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The graphical method starts by flipping (reflecting) one signal about the vertical axis, then shifting, multiplying, and integrating."

      "The integral of the signal"

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "x(t) * δ(t) = x(t). The impulse is the identity element for convolution."
