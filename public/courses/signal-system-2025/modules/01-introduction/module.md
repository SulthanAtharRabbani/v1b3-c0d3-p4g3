# Module 1: Introduction to Signals and Systems

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of signals and systems. Understanding these basics is essential for all subsequent topics in signal processing and system analysis.

## Module Overview

Signals carry information, and systems process signals. This module establishes the foundational definitions and classifications that will be used throughout the course. Students will learn to identify different types of signals and understand how systems transform input signals into output signals.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Define signals and systems mathematically
2. Classify signals by type (continuous/discrete, periodic/aperiodic)
3. Understand the input-output relationship of systems
4. Identify common signal examples in engineering applications

## Topics Covered

1. **What is a Signal?** - Definitions and examples
2. **Signal Classification** - Types and characteristics
3. **What is a System?** - System definition and properties

## Estimated Time

This module should take approximately 4 hours to complete.
