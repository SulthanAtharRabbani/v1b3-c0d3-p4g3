# Metode Transformasi - Transformasi Laplace

This course provides a comprehensive study of the Laplace Transform and its applications in signals and systems analysis. The Laplace Transform is a powerful mathematical tool that transforms differential equations into algebraic equations, making it easier to analyze linear time-invariant systems.

## Course Overview

The Laplace Transform, named after the French mathematician Pierre Simon Laplace (1749-1827), is one of the most important mathematical tools in engineering. It extends the capabilities of Fourier analysis by allowing us to work with signals that may not have Fourier transforms, including growing exponentials and unstable systems.

### What You Will Learn

This course covers the fundamental concepts of Laplace Transform, starting from its definition and building up to advanced applications in circuit analysis and system design. You will learn how to:

- Transform time-domain signals to the complex frequency domain (s-domain)
- Analyze system characteristics using poles and zeros
- Determine system stability and causality
- Solve differential equations with initial conditions
- Design and analyze electrical circuits using transform methods

### Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have a solid understanding of:
- Differential and integral calculus
- Complex numbers and their operations
- Basic electrical circuit theory
- Linear algebra fundamentals

### Course Materials

This course is based on materials from:
- "Signals and Systems: A MATLAB Integrated Approach" by Oktay Alkin
- Lecture modules from "Metode Transformasi (TEL 203)" course

The course integrates theoretical concepts with practical MATLAB examples, helping you develop both mathematical understanding and computational skills.
