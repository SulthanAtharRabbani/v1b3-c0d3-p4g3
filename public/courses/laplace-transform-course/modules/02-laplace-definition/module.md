# Module 2: Laplace Transform Definition and Fundamentals

This module introduces the Laplace Transform, one of the most powerful mathematical tools for analyzing continuous-time signals and systems. We will explore its definition, understand its relationship to the Fourier Transform, and learn to compute transforms of basic signals.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Define the Laplace Transform mathematically
- Understand the relationship between Laplace and Fourier Transforms
- Compute the Laplace Transform of basic signals
- Recognize the importance of the Region of Convergence (ROC)

## Module Overview

The Laplace Transform extends the capabilities of Fourier analysis, allowing us to work with a broader class of signals and systems. This module lays the theoretical foundation that will be built upon in subsequent modules.
