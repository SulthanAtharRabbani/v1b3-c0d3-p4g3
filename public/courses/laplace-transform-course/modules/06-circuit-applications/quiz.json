    "explanation": "The impedance of a capacitor in the s-domain is Z_C = 1/sC. This comes from the Laplace Transform of the capacitor equation i(t) = C·dv/dt, giving I(s) = sC·V(s) - Cv(0⁻), so V(s)/I(s) = 1/sC."

    "explanation": "The initial capacitor voltage v(0⁻) is represented as a series voltage source with value v(0⁻)/s. This accounts for the energy stored in the capacitor before t=0."
