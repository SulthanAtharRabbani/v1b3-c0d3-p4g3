    "options": [
      "A signal defined only at discrete instants of time",
      "A signal defined for all values of time",
      "A signal that is zero for negative time",
      "A signal that repeats periodically"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "A continuous-time signal is defined for all values of time t, where t can take any real value. This is in contrast to discrete-time signals, which are only defined at specific time instants."

    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Linearity and time invariance are the key properties that enable the use of transform methods. LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) systems can be completely characterized by their impulse response and analyzed using convolution or transform techniques."

    "options": [
      "They always give more accurate results",

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Transform methods like the Laplace Transform convert differential equations into algebraic equations, which are much easier to solve. They also naturally incorporate initial conditions into the solution process."
