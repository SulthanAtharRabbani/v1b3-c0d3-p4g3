# Module 7: Inverse Laplace Transform

The inverse Laplace Transform allows us to recover the time-domain signal from its s-domain representation. This module covers the essential techniques for computing inverse transforms, with emphasis on partial fraction expansion.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Apply the inverse Laplace Transform formula
- Perform partial fraction expansion for rational functions
- Handle repeated and complex poles
- Use tables and properties for efficient inverse transformation
