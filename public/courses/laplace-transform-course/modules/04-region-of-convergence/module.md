# Module 4: Region of Convergence

The Region of Convergence (ROC) is a critical concept in Laplace Transform analysis. The same algebraic expression can correspond to different time-domain signals, and the ROC is what distinguishes them.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Define and identify the Region of Convergence
- Determine ROC characteristics for different signal types
- Relate ROC properties to system characteristics
- Use ROC to determine stability and causality
