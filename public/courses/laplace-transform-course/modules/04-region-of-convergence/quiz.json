    "explanation": "The ROC is the set of all values of the complex variable s for which the Laplace Transform integral converges to a finite result. It's essential for uniquely determining the inverse transform."

      "A vertical strip between two lines",

    ],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "For causal signals (zero for t < 0), the ROC is always to the right of a vertical line passing through the rightmost pole. This is because the convergence requirement depends on the behavior as t → ∞."

    "options": [
      "Yes, poles are always inside the ROC",

      "Poles on the jω axis can be in the ROC"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Poles are values of s that make X(s) infinite, so the transform cannot converge at pole locations. The ROC is always bounded by poles but never contains them."

    "question": "For a causal LTI system to be stable, where must its poles be located?",

    ],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "For a causal system to be stable, all poles must be in the left half-plane (have negative real parts). This ensures the ROC includes the jω axis, meaning the system has a Fourier Transform and bounded output for bounded input."

    "explanation": "The transform 1/(s-2) with ROC to the right of the pole at s=2 corresponds to a causal exponential. Using the general form e^(at)u(t) ↔ 1/(s-a), we get x(t) = e²ᵗu(t)."
