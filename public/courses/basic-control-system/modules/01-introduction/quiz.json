      "Ability to reject disturbances automatically",
      "No need for sensors"

    "explanation": "A key advantage of closed-loop control is its ability to automatically compensate for disturbances and maintain desired output despite external influences."

    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "The error signal e(t) = r(t) - b(t) is computed by comparing the reference input with the feedback signal. This error drives the controller to reduce the difference between desired and actual output."

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Open-loop systems cannot sense or correct for disturbances or errors because they have no feedback path. Any disturbance directly affects the output without compensation."

    "options": [
      "The control action increases the output further",
      "The control action decreases to bring output back toward setpoint",
      "The system becomes unstable",
      "The sensor is turned off"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "In negative feedback, when output exceeds setpoint, the error becomes negative, causing the control action to decrease, which brings the output back toward the desired value."
