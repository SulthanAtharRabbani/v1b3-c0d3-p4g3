# Introduction to Control Systems

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of control systems engineering. You will learn what control systems are, explore their historical development, examine practical examples, and understand the crucial distinction between open-loop and closed-loop systems.

## Module Overview

Control systems are everywhere around us - from the thermostat regulating your home temperature to the autopilot systems guiding aircraft. Understanding the principles of control is essential for designing systems that behave predictably and achieve desired objectives.

### What You Will Learn

- The definition and importance of control systems
- Historical development of control theory
- Real-world examples of control applications
- Differences between open-loop and closed-loop systems
- Fundamental concepts of feedback control

### Module Contents

1. **What is Control?** - Basic definitions and terminology
2. **History of Control Systems** - From ancient mechanisms to modern theory
3. **Examples of Control Systems** - Practical applications across industries
4. **Open-loop vs Closed-loop** - Comparison and trade-offs
5. **Feedback Control Concepts** - Core principles of feedback

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Define control systems and explain their purpose
- Identify components of a control system
- Distinguish between open-loop and closed-loop configurations
- Explain the role of feedback in control systems
- Recognize control systems in everyday applications
