# Stability Analysis

Stability is the most fundamental requirement for any control system. An unstable system is useless and potentially dangerous. This module covers the concepts of stability and the Routh-Hurwitz criterion for determining stability without solving for the poles explicitly.

## Module Overview

Before designing a control system, we must ensure it will be stable. This module provides the theoretical foundation for stability and practical methods for stability analysis.

### What You Will Learn

- Definition and types of stability
- Relationship between poles and stability
- Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion
- Special cases in Routh's method

### Module Contents

1. **Stability Concepts** - BIBO stability, asymptotic stability
2. **Routh-Hurwitz Criterion** - Method and application
3. **Special Cases** - Zero in first column, entire row of zeros

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Define stability in the context of control systems
- Determine stability from pole locations
- Apply the Routh-Hurwitz criterion
- Handle special cases in Routh's method
