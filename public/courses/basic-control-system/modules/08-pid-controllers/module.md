# PID Controllers

The Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is the most widely used controller in industrial applications, with over 95% of control loops using PID or variations. This module covers the principles, tuning methods, and design of PID controllers.

## Module Overview

PID controllers combine three control actions to achieve accurate and stable control. Understanding each action and how to tune them is essential for practical control engineering.

### What You Will Learn

- Structure and operation of PID controllers
- Effects of P, I, and D actions
- Ziegler-Nichols tuning methods
- Practical considerations for PID implementation

### Module Contents

1. **Introduction to PID** - Structure and basic operations
2. **PID Tuning Methods** - Ziegler-Nichols and other methods
3. **PID Design** - Design approaches and practical considerations

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the role of each PID component
- Tune PID controllers using standard methods
- Design PID controllers for specific applications
- Handle practical issues like integrator windup
