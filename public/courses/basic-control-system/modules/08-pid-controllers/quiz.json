    "question": "What is the main purpose of the integral term in a PID controller?",
    "options": [
      "To speed up the response",
      "To eliminate steady-state error",
      "To reduce overshoot",
      "To add damping"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "The integral term accumulates error over time and drives it to zero, eliminating steady-state error. It adds a pole at the origin, increasing the system type number."

    "id": "quiz-8-2",
    "question": "What does the derivative term in a PID controller respond to?",
    "options": [
      "Current error magnitude",
      "Accumulated past errors",
      "Rate of change of error",
      "Setpoint value"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "The derivative term responds to the rate of change of error, providing anticipatory action and improving damping."

    "question": "In the Ziegler-Nichols ultimate cycle method, what is Ku?",
    "options": [
      "The process gain",
      "The ultimate gain that causes sustained oscillations",
      "The proportional gain",
      "The derivative gain"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Ku (ultimate gain) is the proportional gain value that causes the closed-loop system to oscillate with sustained oscillations when using only P control."

  {
    "id": "quiz-8-4",
    "question": "What is integrator windup?",
    "options": [
      "The integrator not working",
      "The integrator continuing to accumulate error during saturation",
      "The integrator causing oscillations",
      "The integrator becoming unstable"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Integrator windup occurs when the actuator saturates but the integrator continues accumulating error, causing overshoot and slow recovery."

  {
    "id": "quiz-8-5",
    "question": "According to Ziegler-Nichols ultimate cycle PID tuning, what is Kp as a fraction of Ku?",
    "options": [
      "0.45 Ku",
      "0.5 Ku",
      "0.6 Ku",
      "Ku"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "For PID tuning using the Ziegler-Nichols ultimate cycle method, Kp = 0.6 × Ku."

  {
    "id": "quiz-8-6",
    "question": "Why is a filtered derivative used instead of a pure derivative?",
    "options": [
      "To reduce implementation cost",
      "To reduce noise amplification",
      "To increase response speed",
      "To eliminate steady-state error"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "A pure derivative amplifies high-frequency noise. Adding a filter reduces this sensitivity while still providing derivative action at lower frequencies."
  },
  {
    "id": "quiz-8-7",
    "question": "What is 'derivative kick' and how is it avoided?",
    "options": [
      "Overshoot from derivative; avoided by reducing Kd",
      "Large impulse from step setpoint change; avoided by applying derivative to measurement",
      "Noise amplification; avoided by filtering",
      "Integrator windup; avoided by anti-windup schemes"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Derivative kick occurs when a setpoint step causes a large derivative output. It's avoided by applying the derivative to the measured output (PV) instead of error."
  },
  {
    "id": "quiz-8-8",
    "question": "What is the transfer function of a standard parallel-form PID controller?",
    "options": [
      "Kp + Ki + Kd",
      "Kp(1 + 1/Tis + Tds)",
      "Kp + Ki/s + Kd·s",
      "(Kp + Ki)(Kd·s)"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "The parallel form PID transfer function is Gc(s) = Kp + Ki/s + Kd·s, where each gain acts independently on its respective term."
