# Mathematical Modeling

This module introduces the mathematical foundations essential for control systems analysis and design. Mathematical modeling allows engineers to describe system behavior quantitatively, predict responses, and design controllers systematically.

## Module Overview

Before we can analyze or design control systems, we must be able to describe them mathematically. This module covers the essential mathematical tools needed to model dynamic systems and solve the resulting equations.

### What You Will Learn

- The importance of mathematical modeling in control engineering
- Physical modeling using fundamental laws
- Differential equation representation of dynamic systems
- Laplace transform theory and application
- Partial fraction expansion for solving differential equations

### Module Contents

1. **Introduction to Modeling** - Why modeling matters, physical vs system identification approaches
2. **Differential Equations** - Representation of dynamic systems
3. **Laplace Transform** - Definition, properties, and transform pairs
4. **Partial Fraction Expansion** - Three cases and solution techniques

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain why mathematical modeling is essential for control system design
- Derive differential equations for simple physical systems
- Apply Laplace transforms to convert differential equations to algebraic equations
- Use partial fraction expansion to find inverse Laplace transforms
- Solve linear differential equations using Laplace transform methods
