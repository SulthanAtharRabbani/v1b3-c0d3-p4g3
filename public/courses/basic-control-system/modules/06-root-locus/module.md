# Root-Locus Method

The root-locus method, developed by W.R. Evans in 1948, is a powerful graphical technique for analyzing and designing control systems. It shows how the closed-loop poles move in the s-plane as a system parameter (typically gain) varies from zero to infinity.

## Module Overview

Understanding root locus is essential for control system design, as it provides insight into stability margins and transient response characteristics for different gain values.

### What You Will Learn

- Definition and concept of root locus
- Rules for constructing root locus plots
- Application to control system design
- Design of lead and lag compensators

### Module Contents

1. **Root Locus Concepts** - Definition, angle and magnitude conditions
2. **Root Locus Construction Rules** - Eleven rules for sketching
3. **Root Locus Design** - Using root locus for controller design

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Draw root locus plots by hand using construction rules
- Determine stability ranges from root locus
- Design controllers using root locus methods
- Understand the effect of adding poles and zeros
