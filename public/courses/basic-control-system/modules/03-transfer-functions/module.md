# Transfer Functions and Block Diagrams

This module introduces the transfer function - the fundamental representation of linear time-invariant systems in classical control theory. We also explore block diagram algebra for combining system components and state-space representation for modern control approaches.

## Module Overview

The transfer function provides a compact mathematical description of system dynamics. Combined with block diagram techniques, it forms the foundation for analyzing and designing control systems.
