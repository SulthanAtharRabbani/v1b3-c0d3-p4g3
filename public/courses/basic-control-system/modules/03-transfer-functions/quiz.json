    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "A transfer function is defined as G(s) = Y(s)/U(s), the ratio of the Laplace transform of the output to the Laplace transform of the input, with all initial conditions assumed to be zero."

    "explanation": "Poles (roots of the denominator) determine system stability and the form of the natural response. Poles in the left half-plane indicate stability, while poles in the right half-plane indicate instability."

    "explanation": "A system is stable if all poles have negative real parts (lie in the left half of the s-plane). This means all natural response modes decay to zero over time."
