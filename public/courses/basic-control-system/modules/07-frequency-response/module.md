# Frequency Response Analysis

Frequency response methods analyze system behavior based on the steady-state response to sinusoidal inputs. These methods, developed by Nyquist and Bode in the 1930s-1940s, remain essential tools for control system design.

## Module Overview

Frequency response analysis provides powerful tools for stability analysis, robustness assessment, and compensator design, especially for systems with time delays.

### What You Will Learn

- Bode plot construction and interpretation
- Nyquist stability criterion
- Gain and phase margins
- Frequency-domain design methods

### Module Contents

1. **Bode Plots** - Magnitude and phase plots
2. **Nyquist Criterion** - Stability from open-loop frequency response
3. **Gain and Phase Margins** - Stability margins and robustness

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Construct Bode plots for common transfer functions
- Determine stability using the Nyquist criterion
- Calculate gain and phase margins
- Design compensators using frequency-domain methods
