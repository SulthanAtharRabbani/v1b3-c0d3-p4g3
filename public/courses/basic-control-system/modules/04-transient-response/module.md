# Transient and Steady-State Response

This module examines how control systems respond to inputs over time. Understanding transient and steady-state behavior is essential for evaluating system performance and designing controllers to meet specifications.

## Module Overview

When a system receives an input, its output changes from the initial state to a final state. This change involves both transient response (how the system moves) and steady-state response (where it settles).

### What You Will Learn

- First-order system response characteristics
- Second-order system response and parameters
- Performance specifications for transient response
- Steady-state error analysis and error constants

### Module Contents

1. **First-Order Systems** - Response, time constant, applications
2. **Second-Order Systems** - Damping ratio, natural frequency, response types
3. **Higher-Order Systems** - Dominant poles, approximation methods
4. **Steady-State Errors** - Error constants, system type, analysis

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Analyze first-order system step responses
- Calculate second-order system specifications
- Predict transient response characteristics from transfer functions
- Compute steady-state errors for various inputs
- Determine system type from open-loop transfer functions
