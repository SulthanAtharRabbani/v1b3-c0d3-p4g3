    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Vrms = Vpeak/√2 = 170/1.414 = 120.2V ≈ 120V. This is why North American 120V AC has 170V peak."

    "explanation": "RMS (Root Mean Square) represents the equivalent DC value that would produce the same heating effect in a resistive load. This is why it's the standard measure for AC voltage and current."

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "A square wave has form factor = 1.0. The meter multiplies average by 1.11 (sine wave form factor). Since actual form factor is 1.0, the reading is 11% high."

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Diode junction capacitance bypasses the rectifier at high frequencies, and reverse recovery time limits how fast diodes can switch. These factors limit frequency response."

    "explanation": "Thermal RMS converters use the heating effect of the signal. The signal heats a resistive element, and the temperature rise is compared to a DC reference. When temperatures match, DC equals RMS."
