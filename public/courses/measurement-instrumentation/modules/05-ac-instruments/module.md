# Module 5: AC Measuring Instruments

AC measurements require understanding of waveform characteristics and specialized instrument designs. This module covers the principles of AC measurement and the different types of AC measuring instruments.

## Module Overview

Alternating current presents unique measurement challenges. The instantaneous value varies continuously, and the measured value must represent the effective or equivalent DC value. This module explains how AC instruments work and how to interpret their readings correctly.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Explain AC waveform characteristics including RMS and peak values
2. Describe rectifier-type AC instrument operation
3. Distinguish between average-responding and true RMS measurement
4. Understand frequency response limitations

## Topics Covered

1. **AC Waveform Fundamentals** - RMS, peak, average values and form factors
2. **Rectifier Instruments** - Half-wave and full-wave rectifier meters
3. **True RMS Measurement** - Thermal and computational RMS converters

## Estimated Time

This module should take approximately 4 hours to complete.
