    "question": "What is the primary advantage of an analog display over a digital display?",
    "options": [
      "Higher accuracy",
      "Better trend perception and rate of change indication",
      "Lower cost",
      "Easier to read from a distance"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Analog displays provide continuous indication that allows users to quickly perceive trends and rates of change, which is difficult to see with numeric digital displays."

      "0.001 V",
      "0.01 V",
      "0.1 V",
      "1 V"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "A 3½ digit display can show up to 1999 counts. On a 20V range, resolution = 20V/2000 = 0.01V = 10 mV."

      "9,600 bytes",
      "76,800 bytes",
      "307,200 bytes"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Memory = (Width × Height × Bits per pixel) / 8 = (320 × 240 × 1) / 8 = 9,600 bytes."

    "question": "A data logger with 2 MB memory records 4 channels at 1 sample/second with 2 bytes per sample. How long can it record?",
    "options": [
      "About 12 hours",
      "About 24 hours",
      "About 3 days",
      "About 6 days"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Recording time = Memory / (Channels × Sample rate × Bytes per sample) = 2,097,152 / (4 × 1 × 2) = 262,144 seconds ≈ 3 days."

      "5 mm",
      "10 mm",
      "20 mm",
      "40 mm"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Using the formula H ≥ D/200 where D = 2000mm, the minimum character height is 2000/200 = 10mm."

      "Circular chart recorder",
      "X-Y recorder",
      "Digital recorder"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Circular chart recorders complete one revolution per period (typically 24 hours), making daily patterns immediately visible on the circular display."
