# Module 10: Display, Recording, and Data Representation

## Overview

The final stage of any measurement system is presenting information to the user and preserving it for analysis. This module covers the technologies used to display measurement data, from traditional analog meters to modern graphical interfaces, as well as the systems and formats used to record and store measurement data for later analysis and documentation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Compare analog, digital, and graphical display technologies
2. Understand the operating principles of common display types
3. Evaluate recording systems for different measurement applications
4. Select appropriate data formats for measurement data storage

## Topics Covered

### Lesson 1: Display Technologies
- Analog meter movements and characteristics
- Digital displays and resolution considerations
- Graphical displays and visualization
- Human factors in display design

### Lesson 2: Recording Systems and Data Formats
- Chart recorders and paper-based recording
- Data loggers and digital recording
- Common data formats (CSV, TDMS, HDF5)
- Data integrity and archival considerations

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of measurement fundamentals
- Knowledge of digital systems
- Familiarity with data analysis concepts

## Assessment
