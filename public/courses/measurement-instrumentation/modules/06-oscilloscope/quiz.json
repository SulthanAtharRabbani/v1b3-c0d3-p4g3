    "question": "What is the primary function of the vertical deflection system in an oscilloscope?",
    "options": [
      "To generate the time base for horizontal sweep",
      "To process and scale the input signal for amplitude display",
      "To synchronize the display with the input signal",
      "To store the waveform data in digital memory"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The vertical deflection system processes the input signal through attenuators and amplifiers to scale it appropriately for display on the screen."

    "question": "In oscilloscope triggering, what does the 'trigger level' control?",
    "options": [
      "The amplitude of the displayed signal",
      "The voltage at which the sweep begins",
      "The time per division setting",
      "The number of samples taken per second"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The trigger level sets the voltage threshold at which the horizontal sweep begins, ensuring stable waveform display."

    "question": "According to the Nyquist criterion, what is the minimum sampling frequency required to accurately capture a 100 MHz signal?",
    "options": [
      "100 MHz",
      "150 MHz",
      "200 MHz",
      "400 MHz"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The Nyquist criterion requires the sampling frequency to be at least 2× the highest frequency component. For 100 MHz, this means f_s ≥ 200 MHz."

    "id": "q4",
    "question": "What is the relationship between bandwidth (BW) and rise time (t_r) for a first-order system?",
    "options": [
      "BW = t_r / 0.35",
      "BW = 0.35 / t_r",
      "BW = 0.35 × t_r",
      "BW = 1 / t_r"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The bandwidth-rise time relationship for a first-order system is BW = 0.35/tr, where bandwidth is in Hz and rise time is in seconds."

    "id": "q5",
    "question": "What phenomenon occurs when the sampling rate is too low relative to the signal frequency?",
    "options": [
      "Quantization error",
      "Aliasing",
      "Trigger instability",
      "Vertical saturation"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Aliasing occurs when the sampling rate violates the Nyquist criterion, causing high-frequency signal components to appear as lower frequencies in the sampled data."

    "question": "An oscilloscope has 8-bit vertical resolution and a full-scale range of 10V. What is the theoretical resolution?",
    "options": [
      "10 mV",
      "25 mV",
      "39 mV",
      "78 mV"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Resolution = Full Scale / 2^n = 10V / 256 = 39 mV for an 8-bit ADC."

    "id": "q7",
    "question": "What is the advantage of AC coupling on an oscilloscope input?",
    "options": [
      "It increases the input impedance",
      "It blocks the DC component and displays only AC variations",
      "It improves the trigger stability",
      "It increases the bandwidth"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "AC coupling uses a series capacitor to block the DC component, allowing examination of small AC signals riding on large DC offsets."

      "1 ms",
      "10 ms",
      "100 ms",
      "1 second"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Capture Time = Memory Depth / Sample Rate = 10 Mpoints / 1 GSa/s = 10 milliseconds."

    "question": "For measuring a signal with 10 ns rise time, what minimum oscilloscope bandwidth is recommended for accurate results?",
    "options": [
      "35 MHz",
      "70 MHz",
      "350 MHz",
      "1 GHz"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Using BW = 0.35/tr = 0.35/10ns = 35 MHz. For minimal error, the scope bandwidth should be at least this value, ideally 3× higher."

    "question": "What is the purpose of the trigger holdoff function in an oscilloscope?",
    "options": [
      "To prevent triggering on the wrong edge of complex waveforms",
      "To delay the start of the horizontal sweep",
      "To filter noise from the trigger signal",
      "To adjust the trigger sensitivity"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Trigger holdoff adds a delay after each sweep before the trigger can fire again, preventing multiple triggers on complex waveforms with multiple edges per cycle."
