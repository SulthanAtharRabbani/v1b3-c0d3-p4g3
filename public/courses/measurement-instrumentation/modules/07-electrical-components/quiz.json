    "question": "What is the main limitation of two-wire resistance measurement?",
    "options": [
      "It cannot measure resistances above 1 MΩ",
      "Lead resistance is included in the measurement result",
      "It requires an external power source",
      "It only works for AC signals"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "In two-wire measurement, the current-carrying leads also serve as voltage-sensing leads, so the lead resistance adds to the measured resistance value."

    "question": "In a four-wire (Kelvin) measurement, how is the lead resistance error eliminated?",
    "options": [
      "By using thicker gauge wire",
      "By separating current-carrying and voltage-sensing connections",
      "By using a higher measurement current",
      "By measuring at a lower temperature"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The four-wire method uses separate force leads for current and sense leads for voltage measurement. Since the voltmeter draws negligible current, there's no voltage drop across the sense leads."

    "question": "Why might an LCR meter give different capacitance values at different test frequencies?",
    "options": [
      "The measurement accuracy varies with frequency",
      "Capacitor parameters are inherently frequency-dependent due to ESR, dielectric absorption, and parasitic inductance",
      "Higher frequencies always give higher capacitance readings",
      "The test voltage changes with frequency"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Real capacitors have frequency-dependent behavior due to equivalent series resistance (ESR), dielectric absorption, and parasitic inductance, causing measured values to vary with test frequency."

    "question": "What is the relationship between Q factor and bandwidth in a resonant circuit?",
    "options": [
      "Q = BW / f₀",

      "Q = f₀ × BW",
      "Q = 1 / (f₀ × BW)"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The Q factor equals the resonant frequency divided by the -3 dB bandwidth: Q = f₀/BW. Higher Q means narrower bandwidth."

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Open/short compensation measures and subtracts the parasitic impedance of the test fixture and cables, improving measurement accuracy."
