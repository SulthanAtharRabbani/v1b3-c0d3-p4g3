# Module 2: Errors and Uncertainty in Measurement

No measurement is perfect. Understanding the sources of error and properly expressing measurement uncertainty is essential for reliable measurement practice. This module provides the tools to analyze, quantify, and communicate measurement quality.

## Module Overview

Every measurement result differs from the true value due to various error sources. This module introduces the classification of errors, statistical methods for analyzing measurement data, and the propagation of uncertainties through calculations. Mastering these concepts enables you to express measurement results with appropriate confidence.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Distinguish between systematic and random errors and identify their sources
2. Calculate statistical measures including mean, standard deviation, and confidence intervals
3. Combine uncertainties from multiple sources using propagation rules
4. Express measurement results with appropriate uncertainty statements

## Topics Covered

1. **Types of Measurement Errors** - Systematic, random, and gross errors
2. **Statistical Treatment of Data** - Mean, standard deviation, and confidence intervals
3. **Uncertainty Propagation** - Combining uncertainties from multiple sources

## Estimated Time

This module should take approximately 4 hours to complete, including reading all lessons and taking the quiz.
