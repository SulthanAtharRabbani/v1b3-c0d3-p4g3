# Module 3: Calibration of Measuring Instruments

Calibration is the process of comparing an instrument's readings to known reference values to determine its accuracy. This module covers calibration principles, traceability, and practical procedures.

## Module Overview

Calibration ensures that measurement instruments provide accurate and reliable results. Without proper calibration, measurements may be biased, leading to incorrect decisions in design, manufacturing, and quality control. This module explains how calibration works and why it is essential.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Define calibration and explain its importance in measurement
2. Describe the calibration hierarchy and traceability chain
3. Perform basic calibration procedures
4. Interpret and apply calibration certificates

## Topics Covered

1. **Principles of Calibration** - The calibration process and its objectives
2. **Traceability and Standards** - Hierarchy from primary to working standards
3. **Calibration Procedures** - Methods for different instrument types
4. **Calibration Certificates** - Understanding and applying calibration documentation

## Estimated Time

This module should take approximately 3 hours to complete.
