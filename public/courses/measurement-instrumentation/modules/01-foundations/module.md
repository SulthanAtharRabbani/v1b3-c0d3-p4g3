# Module 1: Foundations of Measurement

This module establishes the fundamental concepts that underpin all measurement activities. Understanding these foundations is essential for selecting appropriate instruments, interpreting results correctly, and recognizing potential sources of error in any measurement system.

## Module Overview

Measurement is the cornerstone of science and engineering. Without the ability to quantify physical phenomena, we cannot analyze, design, or control the world around us. This module introduces you to the basic principles that govern all measurement activities, from the definition of measurement itself to the international system of units that provides a common language for expressing measurement results.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Define measurement and explain its fundamental role in engineering and science
2. Identify and describe the basic components of a measurement system
3. Apply SI units correctly and perform unit conversions
4. Express measurements with appropriate significant figures and scientific notation
5. Understand the concepts of accuracy, precision, resolution, and sensitivity

## Topics Covered

1. **What is Measurement?** - The fundamental process of comparing quantities to standards
2. **Components of a Measurement System** - Sensors, signal conditioning, and display systems
3. **SI Units and Measurement Standards** - The international system of units and traceability
4. **Accuracy, Precision, and Resolution** - Key performance characteristics of measurement systems

## Estimated Time

This module should take approximately 4 hours to complete, including reading all lessons and taking the quiz.
