    "explanation": "The PMMC movement produces deflection proportional to current: θ = (G/Ks) × I. This linear relationship is fundamental to PMMC operation and produces a uniform scale."

    "explanation": "Rs = Vfs/Ifsd - Rm = 10V/50μA - 2000Ω = 200,000 - 2,000 = 198,000 Ω = 198 kΩ"

    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Sensitivity = 1/Ifsd = 1/(50×10⁻⁶) = 20,000 Ω/V. Higher sensitivity means less circuit loading."

      "Random error",
      "Loading error",
      "Gross error"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Loading error occurs because the voltmeter draws current from the circuit, changing the voltage being measured. Higher voltmeter resistance (sensitivity) reduces loading error."

      "Between the positive and negative terminals"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "The shunt resistor is connected in parallel with the PMMC movement. It diverts most of the current around the movement, allowing measurement of currents larger than the movement can handle directly."

    "explanation": "Burden voltage is the voltage drop across the ammeter when current flows through it. Vb = I × Rammeter. This voltage drop can affect circuit operation."

      "Easier to read"

    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Analog meters excel at showing trends because the pointer position gives immediate visual feedback about whether a value is increasing or decreasing. Digital meters show only numerical values."

      "0.001 V",

    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "A 4½-digit display shows 0-19999 counts. Resolution = 20V/20000 = 0.001V = 1mV. The half-digit means the most significant digit can only be 0 or 1."

    "question": "The PMMC movement can only measure DC directly because:",
    "options": [
      "The coil has too much inductance",
      "The pointer cannot follow rapid reversals and averages to zero for AC",
      "The magnet loses its field with AC",
      "The springs only work with DC"
    ],
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "The PMMC movement responds to the average value of current. For AC, the average over a complete cycle is zero, so the pointer doesn't move. Rectifiers are needed to convert AC to DC for measurement."
