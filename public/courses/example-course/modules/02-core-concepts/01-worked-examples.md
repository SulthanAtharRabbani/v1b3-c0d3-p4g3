# Worked Examples

Worked examples are powerful teaching tools that show students how to solve problems step by step.

## Why Examples Matter

Examples help students:

1. **See concepts in action** - Abstract ideas become concrete
2. **Learn problem-solving strategies** - Techniques they can apply
3. **Build confidence** - Success with guided practice
4. **Identify common mistakes** - Avoid pitfalls

## Example Structure

Each example includes:

- **Problem statement** - What we're solving
- **Step-by-step solution** - Click to reveal each step
- **Final answer** - The result

## Interactive Learning

Students can work through examples at their own pace:

1. Read the problem
2. Try to solve it themselves
3. Reveal steps to check their work
4. Learn from the explanations

## Example: Quadratic Equation

**Problem:** Solve for x: $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$

**Solution:**

1. **Identify coefficients**

   From the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:
   - $a = 1$
   - $b = -5$
   - $c = 6$

2. **Calculate the discriminant**

   $$\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1$$

3. **Apply the quadratic formula**

   $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2}$$

4. **Find both solutions**

   $$x_1 = \frac{5 + 1}{2} = 3$$
   
   $$x_2 = \frac{5 - 1}{2} = 2$$

5. **Verify the solutions**

   Check $x = 3$: $3^2 - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0$ ✓
   
   Check $x = 2$: $2^2 - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0$ ✓

## Practice Problems

After understanding the examples, students should try similar problems on their own. The exercises section provides practice opportunities with hints and solutions.
